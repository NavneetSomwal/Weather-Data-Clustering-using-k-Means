# Clustering with scikit-learn
In this notebook, I have performed k-means clustering using scikit-learn in Python.
I have done cluster analysis to generate a big picture model of the weather at a local station using a minute-graunlarity data. In this dataset, data is in the order of millions records. 
NOTE: The dataset we will use is in a large CSV file called minute_weather.csv. The download link is: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8iiZ7pSaSFZb3ItQ1l4LWRMTjg


To summarize, I have clustered weather data into different groups like Dry days, Warm days, Cool days.

Feel free to gets your hand dirty. :D
