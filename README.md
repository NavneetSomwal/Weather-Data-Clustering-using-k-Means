# Clustering with scikit-learn
In this notebook, we will learn how to perform k-means lustering using scikit-learn in Python.
We will use cluster analysis to generate a big picture model of the weather at a local station using a minute-graunlarity data. In this dataset, we have in the order of millions records. How do we create 12 clusters our of them?

NOTE: The dataset we will use is in a large CSV file called minute_weather.csv. The download link is: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8iiZ7pSaSFZb3ItQ1l4LWRMTjg
